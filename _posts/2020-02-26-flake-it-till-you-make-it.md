## About Me

Hello, I'm **[Junwei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FkAGB3MAAAAJ&hl=en)**, a passionate technologist with a diverse background in academia and industry. I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Stony Brook University, focusing on discrete conformal geometry, geometry processing, parallel computing, and computer vision. During my academic tenure, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors such as [David Gu](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~gu/), [Jie Gao](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jie-gao/about/), and [Thomas G. Robertazzi](https://www.ece.stonybrook.edu/~tom/).

Prior to Stony Brook, I contributed to research at the University of Florida alongside [Professor Xiaolin Li](https://cognization.com/andyli/). 

## Professional Journey

My industry journey began with an internship as a Data Scientist at Uber in Autumn 2017, transitioning to a full-time Software Engineer at Uber's Seattle office. I have extensive experience with backend development and distributed systems.

Before Uber, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory and eBay's San Jose office. Following my tenure at Uber, I joined Azure Cloud + AI organization, leading projects on blob storage across different geolocations and optimizing storage solutions with HDDs and SSDs based on usage frequency.

Most recently, I served as a Senior Software Engineer in the Growth Team at DoorDash, focusing on Ads martech development.

## Leadership and Community Engagement

I also serve as a board member of the [Top Geek Organization (TGO)](https://tgo.infoq.cn/), a nonprofit where members include CTOs and VPs from leading Asian tech companies. Additionally, I organize monthly webinars to discuss the latest AI advancements in Silicon Valley.

In the venture capital space, I work as an investment director and scout manager in Silicon Valley and the Boston area, engaging as a VC and angel investor.

## Academic Contributions

In the academic sphere, I am an associate editor for the [IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology(T-CSVT)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=76) journal, overseeing developments in computer vision and multimedia, coordinating faculty and top researchers to review significant papers and advancements in the field.

Thank you for visiting my page and exploring my journey from geometry to the dynamic world of Silicon Valley technology and investment.
